Installed Django several days ago on during pip step in introduction and setup... Saw that it fetched a current Django version and installed everything within the terminal.

pip list is a list of installed packages

pip freeze is a list of installed packages listing their required version

after pip freeze > requirements.txt there is a new requirements.txt file, containing the contents of pip freeze:
"click==6.7
Django==1.10.6
Flask==0.12
itsdangerous==0.24
Jinja2==2.9.5
MarkupSafe==0.23
Werkzeug==0.11.15"

pip show Django:
shows Django Name, Version, Summary, Home Website, Author, Author-email, Liscense, Location, and Requires(empty)

pip uninstall Django:
Ran through and removed all Django files... :(

pip search Flask: Gives a list of all of the descriptions with Flask in them
